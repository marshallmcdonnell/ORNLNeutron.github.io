Files are found by putting 

<ORNLNeutron.github.io/"FOLDER"/"FILE-NAME">

In the address/url/location bar.

I have created  a maquette for the https://neutrons.ornl.gov site. 
This is a flexible and dynmaic route of organizing files for each bean in a way the scientists choose. 
People want what they want and this allows the flexibility for the individual beams to create the most convenient and efficient structure for their respective beam. 

Make any changes to the website you desire or please let me know and I will make the changes accordingly. 

THE ORNL SNS official website is http://neutrons.ornl.gov/

Thank you.
